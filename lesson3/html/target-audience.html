        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience for this site is weather geeks/nerds (geekerds) who share events of interest (e.g. weather-related happenings) within the region.</p>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Molly: a mid-30s stay-at-home mom. She likes being involved in her community and keeping up-to-date on any local events. She would probably be a member of a site like this regardless, but she has always been interested in weather, so that's an added bonus.</li>
            <li>Tim: an early-60s male who is beginning to think about retirement. He has lived in this community his whole life and is well-respected and makes a decent living. A widower, he lives by himself, and although his kids live nearby and visit often, with retirement on the horizon, he is beginning to lean into his hobbies, which include following the weather and being active in the community.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How much damage did the storm last night do?</li>
            <li>Did anyone get any cool pictures of the storm last night?</li>
            <li>What's the weather going to be like for the town festival this weekend?</li>
            <li>When does school start?</li>
            <li>Has anyone seen my lost dog?</li>
        </ul>
